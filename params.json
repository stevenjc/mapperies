They can then see where they have traveled to by viewing where on the map these pictures were taken and can also decide on new places to go.  Additionally, users can add friends, view their albums, and if given the permissions to do so, can upload their pictures to their friends’ albums.  In this way, many users can upload to one album, which is beneficial for situations where many people all wish to have access to all the memories from a trip all stored in one central location.  Furthermore, users can take pictures directly from their mobile device where they can be stored in a specific album.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nTravel lovers can upload and view their pictures on a map and see where they have traveled to.  They can then decide on new places to go. Additionally, they can add friends and share their albums with their friends and compare trips and places that they have been to.  Users can specify for each album, they would like to make it public, where their albums are shown to all of their friends, or choose to keep the album private.  In choosing the private option, they can specify certain friends to share certain albums with.  Within the private option, there is also a view only option, where friends can just see a user's album, or a view and upload option.  With view and upload access, friends can upload their own photos to that album.\r\n\r\n### Mobile\r\nUsers can also log in to the app through their phones and when they select uploading a photo, they can choose to take a picture with their phone, and can then directly upload the picture.
